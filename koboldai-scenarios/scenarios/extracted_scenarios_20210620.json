Trechtus was born in the early years of the Second Era in the Summerset Isles to serfs on the estate of a minor nobleman, Lord Gyrnasse of Sollicich-on-Ker. His father had secretly, against the law of Lord Gyrnasse, taught himself and then Trechtus to read. They had to rely on a black market to get around the restriction Gyrnasse put in place, but still managed to get a steady stream of books and scrolls. When Trechtus was eight, the smugglers were found and imprisoned. Some said that Trechtus's mother, an ignorant and religious woman fearful of her husband, was the betrayer of the smugglers, but there were other rumors as well. The trial of the smugglers was nonexistent, and the punishment swift. The body of Trechtus' father was kept hanging for weeks during the hottest summer Sollicich-on-Ker had seen in centuries.\n\n2. Divayth Fyr was a Dunmer sorcerer born as a Chimer in Tel Aruhn in the early First Era who lived until at least the end of the Third Era, at the age of 4000, and who may still be alive today. Divayth Fyr once studied on the isle of Artaeum, but is said to have left as a \"sharp-elbowed upstart\".

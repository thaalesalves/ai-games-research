# Inventory system
This set of scripts creates a simple inventory system that lets you add and remove stuff from it. Once the game has started, an inventory menu will show up in the adventure menu (the three points on top-right screen).

For now, it'sreally simple. You'll need specific inputs for this system to work. Select the Do option in your gameplay and use the following
`I add <number> <item> to my inventory` (i.e., `I add 1 Coffee Bean to my inventory)
`I remove <number> <item> from my inventory` (i.e., `I remove 1 Coffee Bean from my inventory)
`I check my inventory`

```

You have added 5 Fork to your inventory.

> You remove 3 fork from your inventory.
You have removed 3 Fork from your inventory.

> You check your inventory.
Your inventory contains: 2 Fork,

# Inventory system + Character Sheet
I've been getting a lot of questions on how to integrate the two systems, so here it is. The code is integrated and functional, and you can tweak it to fill your needs. For more info on commands, code, functions and stuff, check each system's README.

* [Inventory](../inventory)
* [Character Sheet](../character-sheet)

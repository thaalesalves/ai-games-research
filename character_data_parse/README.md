# Character data parser
This set of scripts create a simple system to parse and persist character data and use it for later. This was made using Gnurro's placeholder system as a starting point.

The example scripts contained in this repo emulate an Elder Scrolls setting. Depending on the race your character is, the first NPC will say different lines (definied at random, from an array with various options). This dictates how some NPCs will react to the player depending on certain characteristics they have when the game starts.

# AI Dungeon scripts
A few scripts for my scenarios to make the game more fun. Scripts are written in JS (boy oh boy, loose types give the shivers).

## Contents
* **[Inventory](inventory/):** a simple inventory system for your scenarios.
* **[Character data parse](character_data_parse/):** simple functions to parse and persist character data such as name, race and class. (shoutout to [Gnurro](https://github.com/Gnurro/AIDscripts) for some functions)
